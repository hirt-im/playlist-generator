1. Organize files into components
2. Make prompt better to produce better results

Bugs:
1. Sometimes it generates playlist but gets stuck and doesn't add songs
    a. possibly has problems finding certain song uris (maybe if song isn't on spotify)
        i. Solution: while finding songURIs, handle case where song isn't found


Future feature:
1. Obscurity value. Based on value, only pick songs under certain play count





Clean up code and remove dependencies no longer used (e.g. cookie-parser)
