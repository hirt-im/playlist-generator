1. Add option to change number of songs in playlist
2. Add option to make public/private
3. Display playlist after creation

4. Make prompt better to produce better results

Bugs:
Sometimes it doesn't work. Creates playlist but returns empty array that should be songs.
     Perhaps check in case song isn't on spotify or there is error finding it
