0. Store access token somehow (cookies?). On page load, check for accessToken. 
     a. useEffect in App.jsx to check for valid accessToken
     b. have signedIn state to pass to 'Directions' and the 'Generate Playlist!' button (disable if not signed in)

1. Make prompt better to produce better results


Idea: maybe forget all that accesstoken storing stuff. Have them reconnect every time. Otherwise the token will expire in an hour anyway.
It's possible to setup a mechanism to store and automatically refresh the access token when it expires, but that might be beyond the scope of this project. 


ORRRRRRRRRRRRR:
put 'signedIn' into url on redirect from /auth/callback. on pageload, check for a 'signedIn' value in the url, and set signed in state accordingly


Future feature:
1. Obscurity value. Based on value, only pick songs under certain play count





Clean up code and remove dependencies no longer used (e.g. cookie-parser)




IDEA:
Make directions box same size as playlist. Have directions appear at first, on playlist generation, replace directions with playlist
